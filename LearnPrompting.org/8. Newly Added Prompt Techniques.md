**Presets**:
* Write your answer and give me a confidence score between 0-1 for your answer.
* This is very important to my career.
* You'd better be sure.
* Are you sure?
* Are you sure that's your final answer? It might be worth taking another look.
* Are you sure that's your final answer? Believe in your abilities and strive for excellence. Your hard work will yield remarkable results.
* Embrace challenges as opportunities for growth. Each obstacle you overcome brings you closer to success.
* Stay focused and dedicated to your goals. Your consistent efforts will lead to outstanding achievements.
* Take pride in your work and give it your best. Your commitment to excellence sets you apart.

> Limitations include increased computational cost, inefficacy in addressing deep logical errors, and potential redundancy in simpler tasks.

Q: "I ordered a new laptop last week, but it hasn’t arrived yet. The tracking number says it was delivered yesterday, but I never received it. Can you help me figure out what happened?"

**Key**: 
* This is simple, you just have to utilize the LLM to let it paraphrase the question and then answer it.
* This comes with it's own baggage, that the LLM may complicate the original question, or just change the meaning.
* Can be used *creatively* with CoT.

# `4.` SimToM (Simulation Theory of Mind)

* SimToM enhances LLMs' ability to understand and predict human thoughts and actions using a **two-stage** process: Perspective-Taking and Question-Answering.
* In **Stage 1**, the model identifies which events a character is aware of, and in **Stage 2**, it answers questions from that character’s perspective.
* SimToM outperforms traditional prompting techniques like Zero-Shot and Chain-of-Thought in tasks requiring **Theory of Mind (ToM)**.

> **Stage 1, Perspective-Taking**: SimToM filters context based on what the character in question knows
>
> **Stage 2, Question-Answering**: SimToM answers a question about this character's mental state

### Prompt
```markdown
## STAGE-1: Perspective-Taking
The following is a sequence of events: {story}
Which events does {character_name} know about?

## STAGE-2: Question-Answering
{story from character_name’s perspective}
Answer the following question: {question}
```

### Example
```markdown
## STAGE-1: Perspective-Taking
The following is a sequence of events: Noor is working as a barista at a busy coffee shop. Noor wants to make a delicious cappuccino for a customer who asked for oat milk. Noor grabs a milk pitcher and fills it with oat milk. Noor believes that the milk pitcher contains oatmilk. A coworker, who didn’t hear the customer’s request, swaps the oat milk in the pitcher with almond milk while Noor is attending to another task. Noor sees her coworker swapping the milk.

>>> Which events does **{Noor}** know about?

## STAGE-2: Question-Answering

A story from {Noor}'s perspective
>>> Answer the following question: **{Does Noor believe the milk pitcher contains oat milk or almond milk?}**
```

* System 2 Attention (S2A) **filters irrelevant** context from prompts to improve model accuracy.
* It regenerates a cleaner prompt, focusing only on task-relevant information.

### Process

1. Prompt-1: Ask for cleaning
2. Prompt-2: Generate for the final response

## Prompt-1
```markdown
🔥

Given the following text by a user, extract the part that is unbiased and not their opinion, so that using that text alone would be good context for providing an unbiased answer to the question portion of the text.
Please include the actual question or query that the user is asking. Separate this into two categories labeled with “Unbiased text context (includes all content except user’s bias):” and “Question/Query (does not include user bias/preference):”.
Text by User: [Your prompt]
